As part of the diploma thesis, the web application Valley of Positivity was developed. This application is designed to support users in creating a good mood and a positive outlook on life. The application tracks user behavior and, based on that, offers each user a unique user interface tailored to their habits while using the app. This approach ensures simplicity and focus in the application's usage, significantly contributing to the reduction of the "dopamine bomb" effect to which users are exposed through popular applications (primarily social networks).

The backend of the application was developed using the C# programming language and the .NET Framework. The frontend was built using the React TypeScript library. These technologies facilitate the maintenance and expansion of the developed application.
